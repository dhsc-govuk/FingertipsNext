        This data comes from trusted sources such as the NHS and Office of
        National Statistics (ONS). It is analysed to create a wide range of
        health and wellbeing data sets known as indicators, and themed topics
        known as profiles.

      <Paragraph>
        Indicators use data to show us how things are going and if there are any
        changes over time. For example, if the number of people smoking in South
        West England has gone up or down in the last ten years. These indicators
        can be used to compare public heath by areas, and see how it is impacted
        by inequalities such as age, sex or ethnicity.

        <Paragraph>
          Indicators are used to create themed profiles that help build
          understanding of public health at a local, regional and national
          level. For example there will be multiple indicators for diabetes but
          a themed profile may combine other relevant indicators such as smoking
          or obesity to present a more rounded picture of the public health
          impact.
