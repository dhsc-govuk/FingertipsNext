          This data comes from trusted sources such as the NHS and Office of
          National Statistics (ONS). It is analysed to create a wide range of
          health and wellbeing data sets known as indicators, and themed topics
          known as pro files.

        <Paragraph>
          Indicators use data to show us how things are going and if there are
          any changes over time. For example, if the number of people smoking in
          South West England has gone up or down in the last ten years. These
          indicators can be used to compare public heath by areas, and see how
          it is impacted by inequalities such as age, sex or ethnicity.

          The service is free and available to everyone. Its primary role is to
          support health professionals, policymakers, and researchers to monitor
          health trends, identify inequalities, and make informed decisions
          about public health in England.
