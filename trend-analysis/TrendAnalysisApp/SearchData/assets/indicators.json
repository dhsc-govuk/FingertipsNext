These can be seen as two complementary objectives:\r\n\r\npreventing conditions from becoming more serious (wherever possible) and\r\nhelping people to recover effectively\r\n\r\nHealthcare, along with social care, is a major determinant of how well a patient recovers (including through rehabilitation) following illness or injury; if a person does not recover well, it is more likely that they will require hospital treatment again within the next 30 days. Thus, readmissions have been widely used as an indicator of the success of health and social care in helping people to recover.This indicator is also included within the NHS Outcomes Framework under the domain \u0027Helping to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury\u0027.","dataSource":"NHS England","method":"Indirectly age, sex, method of admission and diagnosis or procedure standardised percentage of emergency admissions to any hospital (includes activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector) in England occurring within 30 days of the last, previous discharge from hospital after admission.\r\nIndirect standardisation involves the calculation of the ratio of observed number of events (for the local authority) and the number of events that would be expected if it had experienced the same event rates as those of patients in England, given the casemix of age, sex, method of admission and diagnosis or procedure of its patients.\r\nFor full details of the calculation, see the \u0022Construction\u0022 section of the indicator specification:https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/compendium-emergency-readmissions/current/specifications/emergency-readmissions-within-30-days-of-discharge-from-hospital_4#construction","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":null,"countDefinition":"\r\nThe number of finished and unfinished CIP spells that are emergency admissions within 0-29 days (inclusive) of the last, previous discharge from hospital (see denominator), including those where the patient dies, but excluding the following at readmission:\r\n-Those with a main treatment function and primary diagnosis coded as obstetrics.\r\n-Those with a diagnosis of cancer (other than benign or in situ) or chemotherapy for cancer.\r\n-Those providers that have submitted activity to the Mental Health Services Dataset (MHSDS) and no longer submitting data to HES.\r\n-Those with a main treatment function as mental health services.\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\nSee link for detailed construction: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/compendium-emergency-readmissions/current/specifications/emergency-readmissions-within-30-days-of-discharge-from-hospital_4\r\n","denominatorSource":null,"denominatorDefinition":" \r\nThe number of finished CIP spells with a valid Geographic value, within selected medical and surgical specialties, with a discharge date up to 31st March within the financial year of analysis.

To combat this, previous years have been recalculated. This has affected both the numerators and denominators of the national and subnational count values, decreasing both, including the Deprivation breakdowns.\r\nThe difference in the original values and new recalculated values is greater in earlier years such as 2013/14. The largest example of difference given is of 3.8% lower. The average provider indicator count value in 2013/14 drops by 0.31% and in 2021/22 the drop is less at 0.02%.\r\nThis change in methodology should not result in an increase or a large decrease in the count values, only a minor decrease.\r\nFull details can be found at here: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/find-data-and-publications/statement-of-administrative-sources/methodological-changes#indicators\r\nWhen using indirect standardisation, it is inappropriate to compare sub-geographies with each other, all comparisons should be made with the national figure.","copyright":"Information from NHS England, licenced under the current version of the Open Government Licence.","reuse":"Extracts may only be reproduced by permission.","notes":"The indicator does not make any adjustment for deprivation but does provide a breakdown by deprivation quintile, from 1 \u0026ldquo;most deprived\u0026rdquo; to 5 \u0026ldquo;least deprived\u0026rdquo;.\r\nThe deprivation quintile is derived by linking HES data to the IMD dataset using the lower super output area 2011 (LSOA11) field. An updated version of these indices was published in late 2019 and has been used in place of the 2015 indices.\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\nAs the value type is an indirectly standardised proportion, it is not possible to calculate values without knowing the age, sex, and method of admission and diagnosis or procedure for each patient. For this reason county level data are not presented as these are not published by NHS Digital.NHS England identified a data quality issue affecting HES data for Nottingham University Hospitals Trust (NUH) in 2016 to 2017. Over 30% of records from this trust did not have a valid geography of residence assigned. Therefore, values have not been published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 20% of patients from that area treated at NUH in the previous year (2015 to 2016). Areas where 10% to 20% of the previous year\u0026rsquo;s patients were treated at NUH have been flagged and should be treated with caution.NHS England identified a data quality issue affecting HES data for East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust (RXC) in 2018 to 2019. Approximately 85,000 records erroneously had all diagnosis codes removed. Therefore, values have not been published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 10% of patients from that area with missing diagnosis codes from RXC in the current year (2018 to 2019). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients with missing diagnosis codes from RXC have been flagged to be treated with caution.NHS England identified a data quality issue affecting Frimley Health Foundation Trust in 2022 to 2023. Frimley Health Foundation Trust did not submit HES data for June 2022 to March 2023. Therefore, values have not been published based on HES data for areas that had over 10% of hospital patients from an area treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022) have been flagged to be treated with caution.\r\nThe Coronavirus (COVID19) pandemic began to have an impact on Hospital Episode Statistics data in the 2019 to 2020 financial year, which continued into the 2020 to 2021 financial year. Consequently, the submitted data will show different patterns, such as fewer patients being admitted to hospitals. Therefore statistics that contain data from this period should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\u0026nbsp;\r\nThere is an ongoing review by NHS Digital of Emergency Readmissions which includes indicators across the frameworks. Phase Two of the review has been on hold due to the pandemic . During the review this indicator is designated as an experimental statistic.

The prevalence of dementia increases with age and is estimated to be approximately 20% at 80 years of age. The annual incidence of vascular dementia is 1.2/100 overall person years at risk and is the same in all age groups. Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s disease accounts for 50 - 75% of cases of dementia.The annual incidence of dementia of the Alzheimer type rises to 34.3/100 person years at risk in the 90 year age group; the prevalence is higher in women than in men due to the longer lifespan of women. Other types of dementia such as Lewy Body dementia and fronto-temporal dementia are relatively rare but can be very distressing. In a third of cases, dementia is associated with other psychiatric symptoms (depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, alcohol related problems). A complaint of subjective memory impairment is an indicator of dementia especially when there is altered functioning in terms of activities of daily living.","dataSource":"Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), NHS England","method":"numerator/denominator * 100","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":"Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), NHS Digital","countDefinition":"The number of patients registered with dementia, as recorded on practice disease registers.","denominatorSource":"Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), NHS Digital","denominatorDefinition":"The number of people registered at GP practices (all ages).

This means that previous year\u0027s data needed to be relabelled in the same way and e.g. \u00272015/16\u0027 became \u00272016\u0027.In 2018, substantial changes have been made to the questionnaire and the age of people receiving the questionnaire has been lowered from 18\u002B yrs to 16\u002B yrs.

Babies born to infected mothers are given a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine after they are born. This is followed by another two doses (with a month in between each) and a booster dose 24 months later. Around 20% of people with chronic hepatitis B will go on to develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), which can take 20 years to develop, and around 1 in 10 people with cirrhosis will develop liver cancer.\r\nVaccination coverage is the best indicator of the level of protection a population will have against vaccine preventable communicable diseases. Coverage is closely correlated with levels of disease. Monitoring coverage identifies possible drops in immunity before levels of disease rise.\r\nSince April 2000 it has been recommended that all pregnant women in England and Wales should be offered testing for hepatitis B through screening for HBsAg, and that all babies of HBsAg seropositive women should be immunised (HSC 1998 127). A dose of paediatric hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants born to an HBV infected mother as soon as possible after birth, then at 1 and 2, and 24 months of age (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hepatitis-b-guidance-data-and-analysis). Previous evidence shows that highlighting vaccination programmes encourages improvements in uptake levels may also have relevance for NICE guidance PH21: Reducing differences in the uptake of immunisations (The guidance aims to increase immunisation uptake among those aged under 19 years from groups where uptake is low).","dataSource":"NHS England","method":"Crude percentage: numerator is divided by denominator and then multiplied by 100.","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":null,"countDefinition":"Number of children at age 24 months who have received the complete course (4 doses) of hepatitis B vaccine.

abortion. As well as it being an avoidable experience for the young woman, abortions represent an avoidable cost to the NHS. And while for some young women having a child when young can represent a positive turning point in their lives, for many more teenagers bringing up a child is extremely difficult and often results in poor outcomes for both the teenage parent and the child, in terms of the baby\u0026rsquo;s health, the mother\u0026rsquo;s emotional health and well-being and the likelihood of both the parent and child living in long-term poverty.\r\nResearch evidence, particularly from longitudinal studies, shows that teenage pregnancy is associated with poorer outcomes for both young parents and their children. Teenage mothers are less likely to finish their education, are more likely to bring up their child alone and in poverty and have a higher risk of poor mental health than older mothers. Infant mortality rates for babies born to teenage mothers are around 60% higher than for babies born to older mothers. The children of teenage mothers have an increased risk of living in poverty and poor quality housing and are more likely to have accidents and behavioural problems.\r\nAs well as being included in the Public Health Outcomes Framework, teenage pregnancy has also been included as a child poverty strategy indicator 2011-14, in the \u0022A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families\u0027 Lives\u0022 document, published jointly between the Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Education, April 2011More background information and advice on tackling teenage pregnancy is provided in Public Health England\u0027s joint paper with the Local Government Association (LGA) published January 2016 \u0027Good progress but more to do - Teenage pregnancy and young parents\u0027","dataSource":"OHID, based on Office for National Statistics data","method":"Crude rate: numerator is divided by denominator and then multiplied by 1,000","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":"Office for National Statistics (ONS), Conceptions in England and Wales","countDefinition":"Number of pregnancies that occur in women aged under 18 and result in either one or more live or still births or a legal abortion under the Abortion Act 1967.","denominatorSource":"Office for National Statistics (ONS), Mid-year population estimates","denominatorDefinition":"Number of women aged 15-17 living in the area","disclouseControl":"For Isles of Scilly and City of London, no indicator data are presented, to prevent disclosure of small numbers.

permanently.Research by the Royal National Institute for Blind People (RNIB) suggests that 50 percent of cases of blindness and serious sight loss could be prevented1,2\u0026nbsp;if detected and treated in time. Whilst this is mainly due to uncorrected refractive error and untreated cataract, the research implies that the take up of sight tests is lower than would be expected. This is particularly the case within areas of social deprivation. Low take up of sight tests can lead to later detection of preventable conditions and increased sight loss due to late intervention.\r\nInclusion of this indicator in the public health outcomes framework will ensure that avoidable sight loss is recognised as a critical and modifiable public health issue. Prevention of avoidable sight loss is recognised as a key priority for the WHO\u0027s global initiative for the 2030 targets on effective coverage of eye care. The overarching aim of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) to which the UK is a signatory - is to improve the coverage of eye health and prevent blindness\u0026nbsp;https://www.iapb.org/about/2030-in-sight/\u0026nbsp;It is a particularly important issue in the context of an ageing population.The Law Commission report (Adult Social Care, May 2011) recommended that local authorities should maintain a register of blind and partially sighted people (Paragraphs 12.15 to 12.18)3\u0026nbsp;and this recommendation has been accepted by Department of Health and Social Care Ministers. Completion of a CVI (Certificate of Visual Impairment) by a consultant ophthalmologist, initiates the process of registration with a local authority and leads to access to services.Risk of sight loss is heavily influenced by health inequalities, including ethnicity, deprivation and age. Sight loss can increase the risk of depression, falls and hip fractures, loss of independence and living in poverty2.1.

Certification is voluntary so true rates may be higher than this analysis shows. Incidence may vary due to the risk of sight loss being influenced by health inequalities, including ethnic, deprivation and age profiles of the local population. People that have a Certificate of Vision Impairment from an ophthalmologist choose whether or not to be included in their local authority\u0026rsquo;s register of blind or partially sighted people (registration is not automatic). Those that register become eligible for certain concessions. This means that not everybody that has been certified as having a vision impairment is recorded on a local authority register.There are also geographic variations in data collection. In some instances completion of additional examinations required to complete the certification are incentivised. Due to this, data collection levels may reflect non-completion of certification rather than just low incidence. Analysis by Moorfields has shown that there is greater than a 10% difference in 2010 to 11 between certifications of visual impairment (CVIs) and registrations with local authorities in these areas: Bath and North East Somerset, Birmingham, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Bristol, Bromley, Bury, Croydon, Dudley, Hillingdon, Kingston upon Thames, Leeds, Luton, Manchester, Medway Towns, North Lincolnshire, North Somerset, Redbridge, Rochdale, Salford, Sandwell, South Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Stockport, Stoke on Trent, Tameside, Trafford, Walsall, Warwickshire and Wiltshire, and\u0026nbsp; comparison to an expected value produced by indirect standardisation methods.

100,000.","rationale":"Falls are the largest cause of emergency hospital admissions for older people, and significantly impact on long term outcomes, e.g. being a major precipitant of people moving from their own home to long term nursing or residential care[1].\r\nThe highest risk of falls is in those aged 65 and above and it is estimated that about 30 percent people (2.5 million) aged 65 and above living at home and about 50 percent of people aged 80 and above living at home or in residential care will experience an episode of fall at least once a year [2]. Falls that results in injury can be very serious - approximately 1 in 20 older people living in the community experience a fracture or need hospitalisation after a fall. Falls and fractures in those aged 65 and above account for over 4 million bed days per year in England alone, at an estimated cost of \u0026pound;2 billion [3].\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has produced a quality standard that covers assessment after a fall and preventing further falls (secondary prevention) in older people living in the community and during a hospital stay. The standard is designed to drive measurable improvements in the 3 dimensions of quality: patient safety, patient experience and clinical effectiveness. [2]\r\nThis measure should be understood in terms of assessing health service utilisation:\u0026nbsp; the number divided by\u0026nbsp; rate of patients with falls related emergency admissions entering a hospital setting. It should not be used to assess need as many injurious falls will not result in emergency admissions. It should also not be used to assess falls prevention service effectiveness as there are a number of conditions which will increase susceptibility to injury, including osteoporosis, the treatment of which is the remit of other services.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\r\n1.

Early adopter sites began to report SDEC to ECDS from 2021/22, with other Trusts changing their reporting in 2022/23 or 2023/24. Some Trusts had previously reported this activity as part of the Admitted Patient Care data set, and moving to report to ECDS may reduce the number of admissions reported for this indicator. NHSE have advised it is not possible accurately to identify SDEC in current data flows, but the impact of the change is expected to vary by diagnosis, with indicators related to injuries and external causes potentially most affected.\r\nWhen considering if SDEC recording practice has reduced the number of admissions reported for this indicator at local level, please refer to the\u0026nbsp;published list\u0026nbsp;of sites who have reported when they began to report SDEC to ECDS.\r\nHospital admissions have been used as a proxy of the prevalence of falls injuries, these are only the tip of the iceberg in relation to the health and well being burden of falls. Inpatient hospital admissions are a proportion of falls incidents, more may present to A\u0026amp;E and GPs, not all of which will lead to hospital admission.This indicator only counts falls that have been coded in the cause field and Injuries in primary diagnosis field. It has been observed that there are situations where falls (ICD10 W00 to W19) and Injuries (S00 to T98) are coded in secondary diagnosis fields. This may result in underestimation of falls resulting in injuries.HES inpatient data are generally considered to be complete and robust. However, there may be a question regarding the quality of external cause coding and differences in admission thresholds. There may be variation between Trusts in the way hospital admissions are coded. There may be variation in data recording completeness. Injury information could potentially be missing in the admission episode record but added instead to a subsequent episode record. In addition, some transfers which are also coded as episode order 1 (epiorder 1) and emergency could lead to double counting.Of particular relevance is the coding of external cause. Routine data do not allow for all of these aspects to be identified and removed from the indicator, however, this may be done through local audit.","copyright":"\u0026copy; Crown Copyright Under the terms of the Open Government licence (OGL)","reuse":"This material is Crown Copyright but may be reproduced without formal permission or charge for personal or in house use and should be acknowledged as \u00A9 Crown Copyright, source: Office for Health Improvement and Disparities 2024\u0027.","notes":"\r\nFollowing Census 2021, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) carried out reconciliation and rebasing of the mid year population estimates (MYE) it produces. This process happens every 10 years following the census. The official population estimates for mid 2012 to mid 2020 have been revised, to incorporate the data now available from Census 2021. The data for this indicator has been revised to use the rebased population estimates from 2012 onwards.\r\nWhere the observed total number of admissions is less than 10, the rates have been suppressed as there are too few admissions to calculate directly standardised rates reliably. The cut off has been reduced from 25, following research commissioned by PHE and in preparation for publication which shows DSRs and their confidence intervals are robust whenever the count is at least 10.\r\nThis indicator was calculated using age standardisation (as opposed to age sex standardisation) and the England value was changed to include the records where the LA of residence equals \u0026lsquo;U\u0026rsquo; (England NOS). The exact method is no longer used for the confidence intervals whereas it used to be used for the local authorities with small counts, and the counts for persons is found using all records regardless of the coding of gender (rather than the sum of males and females).\r\nNHS England identified a data quality issue affecting HES data for Nottingham University Hospitals Trust (NUH) in 2016 to 2017. Over 30% of records from this trust did not have a valid geography of residence assigned. Therefore values have not published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 20% of patients from that area treated at NUH in the previous year (2015 to 2016). Areas where 10% to 20% of the previous year\u0026rsquo;s patients were treated at NUH have been flagged and should be treated with caution.\r\nNHS England identified a data quality issue affecting HES data for East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust (RXC) in 2018 to 2019. Approximately 85,000 records erroneously had all diagnosis codes removed. Therefore, values have not been published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 10% of patients from that area with missing diagnosis codes from RXC in the current year (2018 to 2019). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients with missing diagnosis codes from RXC have been flagged to be treated with caution.\r\nNHS England identified a data quality issue affecting Frimley Health Foundation Trust in 2022 to 2023. Frimley Health Foundation Trust did not submit HES data for June 2022 to March 2023. Therefore, values have not been published based on HES data for areas that had over 10% of hospital patients from an area treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022) have been flagged to be treated with caution.\r\n","frequency":"Annual","rounding":"All sub national counts are rounded to the nearest 5.

The figures are not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area could actually expect to live in good general health, both because the health prevalence and mortality rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.","rationale":"This indicator is an extremely important summary measure of mortality and morbidity in itself.

This means that previous year\u0027s data needed to be relabelled in the same way and e.g. \u00272015/16\u0027 became \u00272016\u0027.In 2018, substantial changes have been made to the questionnaire and the age of people receiving the questionnaire has been lowered from 18\u002B yrs to 16\u002B yrs.

Everyone between the ages of 40 and 74, who has not already been diagnosed with one of these conditions, will be invited (once every five years) to have a check to assess their risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease and diabetes and will be given support and advice to help them reduce or manage that risk.

To estimate the number of people on existing disease registers and therefore not eligible for a NHS Health Check, the age and sex specific weightings used in the NHS Health Check Ready Reckoner tool are applied to the local population.\r\nSince 2019/20, the TEP has also been adjusted to remove prisoners serving a sentence of 6 months or more.\r\n\u0026bull; Those prisoners are included in ONS mid-year population estimates, however prisoners serving a sentence above 2 years receive checks commissioned by NHS England rather than by local authorities.\r\n\u0026bull; Prisoners serving a sentence of at least 6 months but under 2 years were also excluded from the TEP because, although they aren\u0026rsquo;t eligible for an NHS England check, by virtue of them being in prison they can\u0026rsquo;t access a NHS Health Check provided by the local authority.\u0026nbsp;\r\nIn addition, every year local authorities able to identify the eligible population from their local general practice clinical systems or who have undertaken a more accurate assessment of the eligible population can use this TEP estimate rather than OHID estimates.","disclouseControl":"None applied","caveats":"The NHS Health Checks programme became the responsibility of Local Authorities in April 2013. There is still considerable variation between local authorities in the reported numbers of Health Checks offered and received. In some cases the variation may be the result of data quality issues.

The Wilson Score method is the preferred method for calculating confidence intervals for proportions and odds, but it can also be used for rates, as long as the event rate is low (relatively rare events within the population) as the Binomial distribution is a very good approximation to the Poisson distribution when the event rate is low. The method is described in detail in APHO Technical Briefing 3: Commonly used public health statistics and their confidence intervals.2\r\n1\u0026nbsp;Wilson EB.

To estimate the number of people on existing disease registers and therefore not eligible for a NHS Health Check, the age and sex specific weightings used in the NHS Health Check Ready Reckoner tool are applied to the local population.\r\nSince 2019/20, the TEP has also been adjusted to remove prisoners serving a sentence of 6 months or more.\r\n\u0026bull; Those prisoners are included in ONS mid-year population estimates, however prisoners serving a sentence above 2 years receive checks commissioned by NHS England rather than by local authorities.\r\n\u0026bull; Prisoners serving a sentence of at least 6 months but under 2 years were also excluded from the TEP because, although they aren\u0026rsquo;t eligible for an NHS England check, by virtue of them being in prison they can\u0026rsquo;t access a NHS Health Check provided by the local authority.\u0026nbsp;\r\nIn addition, every year local authorities able to identify the eligible population from their local general practice clinical systems or who have undertaken a more accurate assessment of the eligible population can use this TEP estimate rather than OHID estimates.","disclouseControl":"None applied","caveats":"The NHS Health Checks programme became the responsibility of Local Authorities in April 2013. There is still considerable variation between local authorities in the reported numbers of Health Checks offered and received. In some cases the variation may be the result of data quality issues. For example, for a few local authorities, the number of checks offered is the same as the number of checks received. Data quality issues may affect the indicator and England comparator values of both offers and received numbers of Health Checks should be interpreted together.\r\n\r\nThe Health Check Programme aims to cover the eligible population over a 5 year period i.e. 20% of the eligible population invited for NHS Health Checks each year. The total number of people offered an NHS Health Check in the financial year does not, therefore, represent the total population eligible for a Health Check.Please note due to boundary changes and the separation of Northamptonshire local authority from April 2021, for North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire, data before quarter 1 2021-22 is not available and therefore data will be substantially lower compared to other local authorities for all three 5-year rolling\u0026nbsp;cumulative\u0026nbsp;indicators.","copyright":"\u00A9 Crown Copyright 2013","reuse":"These source data are publically available and there are no restrictions on their re-use.","notes":"Indicator values have not been calculated for those authorities where the numerator and denominator are both zero.","frequency":"Quarterly","rounding":null,"associatedAreaCodes":["E92000001","E06000001","E06000002","E06000003","E06000004","E06000005","E06000006","E06000007","E06000008","E06000009","E06000010","E06000011","E06000012","E06000013","E06000014","E06000015","E06000016","E06000017","E06000018","E06000019","E06000020","E06000021","E06000022","E06000023","E06000024","E06000025","E06000026","E06000027","E06000030","E06000031","E06000032","E06000033","E06000034","E06000035","E06000036","E06000037","E06000038","E06000039","E06000040","E06000041","E06000042","E06000043","E06000044","E06000045","E06000046","E06000047","E06000049","E06000050","E06000051","E06000052","E06000053","E06000054","E06000055","E06000056","E06000057","E06000058","E06000059","E06000060","E06000065","E06000066","E08000001","E08000002","E08000003","E08000004","E08000005","E08000006","E08000007","E08000008","E08000009","E08000010","E08000011","E08000012","E08000013","E08000014","E08000015","E08000016","E08000017","E08000018","E08000019","E08000021","E08000022","E08000023","E08000024","E08000025","E08000026","E08000027","E08000028","E08000029","E08000030","E08000031","E08000032","E08000033","E08000034","E08000035","E08000036","E08000037","E09000001","E09000002","E09000003","E09000004","E09000005","E09000006","E09000007","E09000008","E09000009","E09000010","E09000011","E09000012","E09000013","E09000014","E09000015","E09000016","E09000017","E09000018","E09000019","E09000020","E09000021","E09000022","E09000023","E09000024","E09000025","E09000026","E09000027","E09000028","E09000029","E09000030","E09000031","E09000032","E09000033","E10000003","E10000007","E10000008","E10000011","E10000012","E10000013","E10000014","E10000015","E10000016","E10000017","E10000018","E10000019","E10000020","E10000024","E10000025","E10000028","E10000029","E10000030","E10000031","E10000032","E10000034","E12000001","E12000002","E12000003","E12000004","E12000005","E12000006","E12000007","E12000008","E12000009","E40000003","E40000005","E40000006","E40000007","E40000010","E40000011","E40000012","E47000001","E47000002","E47000003","E47000004","E47000006","E47000007","E47000008","E47000009","E47000010","E47000011","E54000008","E54000010","E54000011","E54000013","E54000015","E54000018","E54000019","E54000022","E54000023","E54000024","E54000025","E54000026","E54000027","E54000028","E54000029","E54000030","E54000031","E54000032","E54000034","E54000036","E54000037","E54000038","E54000039","E54000040","E54000041","E54000042","E54000043","E54000044","E54000048","E54000050","E54000051","E54000052","E54000053","E54000054","E54000055","E54000056","E54000057","E54000058","E54000059","E54000060","E54000061","E54000062","E06000061","E06000062","E06000063","E06000064"],"latestDataPeriod":2020,"earliestDataPeriod":2020,"lastUpdatedDate":"2024-11-27T13:38:22","usedInPoc":true,"hasInequalities":true,"hideInSearch":false,"indicatorID":91112,"polarity":"High is good","benchmarkComparisonMethod":"Confidence intervals overlapping reference value (95.0)","valueType":"Proportion","indicatorName":"People receiving an NHS Health Check","yearType":"Financial multi year cumulative quarters","hasMultipleSexes":false,"hasMultipleAges":false,"hasMultipleDeprivation":true},{"denominatorType":"Population","ciMethod":"Byar\u0027s method","unitLabel":"per 100","unitValue":"100","indicatorDefinition":"The number of urgent suspected cancer referrals observed the registered population divided by the number expected based on the practice\u0027s age-gender specific population and the age-gender specific rates for England.","rationale":"Urgent suspected cancer referrals are a managed route to secondary care, for investigation of possible cancer symptoms, with the intention to efficiently investigate the symptoms and, when a cancer is diagnosed, ensure the patient\u0027s cancer treatment and care is well managed within the system.

The population monitoring cut offs for overweight and obesity are lower than the clinical cut offs (91st and 98th centiles for overweight and obesity) used to assess individual children; this is to capture children in the population in the clinical overweight or obesity BMI categories and those who are at high risk of moving into the clinical overweight or clinical obesity categories. This helps ensure that adequate services are planned and delivered for the whole population.","rationale":"There is concern about the rise of childhood obesity and the implications of obesity persisting into adulthood. The risk of obesity in adulthood and risk of future obesity-related ill health are greater as children get older. Studies tracking child obesity into adulthood have found that the probability of children who are overweight and living with obesity becoming overweight or obese adults increases with age1,2,3. The health consequences of childhood obesity include: increased blood lipids, glucose intolerance, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, increases in liver enzymes associated with fatty liver, exacerbation of conditions such as asthma and psychological problems such as social isolation, low self-esteem, teasing and bullying.Child obesity prevalence shows a close association with socioeconomic deprivation. Obesity prevalence in children living in the 10% most deprived areas of the country is more than double that of children living in the least deprived 10% of areas4. Between ethnic groups, obesity prevalence substantially varies; these differences remain when potentially confounding factors, such as levels of deprivation and urban environment are controlled for5,6,7,8.These data indicators enable monitoring of the national ambition to \u0022significantly reduce childhood obesity\u0022 as set out in\u0026nbsp;\u0022Child Obesity A Plan for Action\u0022.\r\nThe National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence have produced guidelines to tackle obesity in adults and children -\u0026nbsp;Obesity: the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children.1\u0026nbsp;Guo SS, Chumlea WC.

Local authorities are mandated to collect data from mainstream state-maintained schools but collection of data from special schools (schools for pupils with special educational needs and pupil referral units) and independent schools is encouraged. For the 2022/23 collection, 4,802 records were collected relating to pupils in independent/special schools. This represents only 0.4% of the total number of records across all state and independent/special schools.Since the proportion of records from independent and special schools is low and varies each year, analysis of NCMP data by NHS England and DHSC excludes such records to ensure consistency over time. There are also concerns around how representative the participating independent and special schools would be.Deprivation has been assigned using the assigned Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) in the NCMP dataset, up to 2014/15 to 2018/19. Deprivation using IMD 2019 has been assigned to data for 2015/16 to 2019/20 onwards.The indicator is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator and then multiplying by 100 to produce the percentage.","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":"NHS England, National Child Measurement Programme, https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/","countDefinition":"Number of children in year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) with a valid height and weight measured by the NCMP with a BMI classified as living with obesity or severe obesity.","denominatorSource":"NHS England, National Child Measurement Programme, https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/","denominatorDefinition":"Number of children in year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) with a valid height and weight measured by the NCMP.","disclouseControl":"City of London totals have been included with Hackney and Isles of Scilly totals with Cornwall UA to prevent potential disclosure of individuals.Any value based on a numerator that is 7 or less is suppressed.

The prevalence rates and data quality indicators for all sub-national geographies are calculated using these rounded values. Confidence intervals are calculated on the unrounded numerators and dominators.\u0026nbsp;Further information on this method of disclosure control is available from NHS England.","caveats":"There is the potential for error in the collection, collation and interpretation of the data (bias may be introduced due to poor response rates and selective opt out of children with a high BMI for age/sex which it is not possible to control for).There is not a good measure of response bias and the degree of selective opt out, but participation rates (the proportion of eligible school children who were measured) may provide a reasonable proxy; the higher the participation rate, the less chance there is for selective opt out, though this is\u0026nbsp; not a perfect method of assessment.","copyright":"\u0026copy; Crown copyright","reuse":"Please cite any use of this website as follows specifying the date of access:\r\nOffice for Health Improvement and Disparities. Obesity Profile. 2023 https://fingertips.phe.org.uk \u00A9 Crown copyright","notes":"The local authority level data for obesity prevalence by sex, ethnic group, and deprivation quintile in the inequalities tab of the Obesity Profile uses 5 years worth of data combined to ensure a large enough sample size for reliable estimates.Data from the 2020/21 NCMP collection year has not been included in the 5-year combined indicators. Around 300,000 children (25% of previous full measurement years) were measured enabling robust prevalence estimates to be produced at national and regional level, however the sample did not enable the production of comprehensive and robust local authority level data. To ensure that large enough numbers are available for analysis, an additional year of NCMP data is included instead of 2020/21; data for 2017/18-21/22 uses 2016/17 data instead of 2020/21, and data for 2018/19-22/23 uses 2017/18 data instead of 2020/21.\u0026nbsp;Data are provided in the Inequalities data view, for sex, ethnicity and deprivation.\r\nLocal authority and region geographies are derived from the postcode of child residency; only children with valid geographical coding (postcode of residence) have been included in this analysis. The proportion of records with such coding has increased over the years of the NCMP. In 2006/07 (the first year of the NCMP) around 57% of child records included valid postcode of residence. This increased to 95% in 2007/08, and to over 99% in 2008/09 and subsequent years.Recording of ethnicity has improved overtime, but data from the earlier years of the NCMP collection may not be fully complete; the proportion of records with valid ethnicity coding has increased substantially since the NCMP inception. In 2006/07 only 32% of child records had an informative ethnicity code (i.e. not \u0026lsquo;unknown\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;not stated\u0026rsquo;), in 2009/10, this had increased to 83%, and since then has remained over 80%. It is possible that completeness of ethnicity coding may vary with weight status, leading to potential bias in the prevalence estimates. Such bias is hard to detect. Lower rates of ethnicity coding in the earlier years of NCMP also lead to smaller numbers of children in each ethnic group.In some years, local authorities have been unable to provide ethnicity data. Therefore caution should be applied when interpreting obesity prevalence by ethnic group, and the data presented here should be viewed in conjunction with the data quality indicators presented in the \u0022Data quality\u0022 section of this tool.Deprivation data are provided by deprivation quintiles (groups of\u0026nbsp; five equal-sized bands), based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile (ten equal-sized bands).\u0026nbsp;2019 IMD is applied to 2015/16-2019/20\u0026nbsp; and later data. IMD for all previous years uses that provided in the dataset each year by NHS England. Not all local authorities will contain areas for each deprivation quintile, for example, some local authorities within England have no areas that are in the most deprived category. In 2013/14, no postcode data were supplied for children attending school in Herefordshire.

Approximately 85,000 records erroneously had all diagnosis codes removed. Therefore, values have not been published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 10% of patients from that area with missing diagnosis codes from RXC in the current year (2018 to 2019). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients with missing diagnosis codes from RXC have been flagged to be treated with caution.NHS England identified a data quality issue affecting Frimley Health Foundation Trust in 2022 to 2023.

Therefore, values have not been published based on HES data for areas that had over 10% of hospital patients from an area treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022) have been flagged to be treated with caution.Following the conclusion of the consultation (6) the trend will only go back to 2016/17.This indicator is based on admission episodes to hospital for alcohol related conditions.\u0026nbsp; This counts the number of times that a person has been admitted to hospital in the year with an alcohol related condition, and not the person themselves.Where the observed total number of admissions is less than 10, the rates have been suppressed as there are too few admissions to calculate directly standardised rates reliably. The cut-off has been reduced from 25, following research commissioned by PHE and in preparation for publication which shows DSRs and their confidence intervals are robust whenever the count is at least 10.The COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact on hospital activity with a reduction in admissions in 2020 to 2021. Because of this, NHS Digital have been unable to analyse coverage (measured as the difference between expected and actual records submitted by NHS Trusts) in the normal way. There may have been issues around coverage in some areas which were not identified as a result.\r\n(6)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2021) Proposed changes for calculating alcohol-related mortality\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-for-calculating-alcohol-related-mortality","frequency":"Annual.","rounding":"All sub national counts are rounded to the nearest 5.

the government Sport Strategy and Chief Medical Officer (CMO) recommendations. To ensure we align with the CMO guidelines OHID also publish the estimates for those aged 19 and over.(1). Physical inactivity is defined as engaging in less than 30 minutes of physical activity per week. This is the same definition as one of the KPIs in the current government sport strategy (Sporting Future: A New Strategy for an Active Nation)(2). The strategy reports the percentage of adults physically inactive and is measured by the \u0026ldquo;percentage doing less than 30 mins physical activity each week\u0026rdquo;. (2). Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality accounting for 6% of deaths globally. People who have a physically active lifestyle have a 20 to 35% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those who have a sedentary lifestyle.\u0026nbsp; Regular physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and colon/breast cancer and with improved mental health.\u0026nbsp; In older adults physical activity is associated with increased functional capacities. The estimated direct cost of physical inactivity to the NHS across the UK is over \u0026pound;0.9 billion per year.The CMO currently recommends that adults undertake a minimum of 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate physical activity per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week or an equivalent combination of the two (MVPA), in bouts of 10 minutes or more. The overall amount of activity is more important than the type, intensity or frequency.(1).While increasing the activity levels of all adults who are not meeting the recommendations is important, targeting those adults who are significantly inactive (i.e. engaging in less than 30 minutes of activity per week) will produce the greatest reduction in chronic disease.(1).Public Health England co-produced the \u0026lsquo;Everybody active, every day\u0026rsquo; framework.(3) This is a national, evidence-based approach to support all sectors to embed physical activity into the fabric of daily life and make it an easy, cost-effective and \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; choice in every community in England. To make everybody active every day a reality we need to monitor progress and measure the impact at a population, organisational, programme and individual level. The key outcomes within the public health outcomes framework (PHOF) will be central, ie, the percentage of adults physically inactive (primary outcome, PHOF 2.13ii) and physically active (secondary, PHOF 2.13i).Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to increase the population levels of physical activity is summarised by Kahn et al.(4)1.

Number of minutes presented is the moderate intensity equivalent minutes of activity, which consists of moderate activity plus double the number of vigorous minutes of activity.The (broad) activities included in the estimates are grouped as sporting activities, fitness activities, cycling for leisure and sport, cycling for travel, walking for leisure, walking for travel, creative or artistic dance and gardening.\u0026nbsp;The counts are weighted to be representative of the national population.","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":"An approximate 95% and 99.8% confidence interval was derived from 10,000 simulations of physical inactivity prevalence for each age group within each area.

On average, smokers have more complications during pregnancy and labour, including bleeding during pregnancy, placental abruption and premature rupture of membranes.\r\nEncouraging pregnant women to stop smoking during pregnancy may also help them kick the habit for good, and thus provide health benefits for the mother and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke by the infant.\r\nSmoking during pregnancy can cause serious pregnancy-related health problems. These include complications during labour and an increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth, low birth-weight and sudden unexpected death in infancy.\r\nThe Tobacco Control Plan contains a national ambition to reduce the rate of smoking throughout pregnancy to 6% or less by the end of 2022 (measured at time of giving birth). The inclusion of this indicator will ensure that the local tobacco control activity is appropriately focused on pregnant women, in order to try to achieve this national ambition.\r\nInclusion of this indicator will also encourage the continued prioritisation of action to reduce smoking at delivery. Decreases in smoking during pregnancy will result in health benefits for the infant and mother, as well as cost savings to the NHS.","dataSource":"Calculated by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities from the NHS England return on Smoking Status At Time of delivery (SATOD)","method":"Crude percentage: numerator is divided by denominator and then multiplied by 100.","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":"NHS England return on Smoking Status At Time of delivery (SATOD)","countDefinition":"Number of women known to smoke at time of delivery.Numerator counts for local authorities are estimated from counts for sub-ICBs.

More information is available in the Government response to the consultation on PHOF. https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/520455/PHOF_cons_response.pdfDenominators for local authorities are estimated from denominators for sub-ICB locations (prior to 2013/14 estimates were based on denominators for PCTs). Denominators for sub-ICB locations include all women resident within the sub-ICB locations boundary, and no data are available to break down the sub-ICB locations denominators for different areas within the sub-ICB locations. Denominators for local authorities are estimated as follows:(i) For local authorities that have exactly the same boundary as a sub-ICB location, the sub-ICB location\u0026nbsp;figure is used as it is the correct figure for the local authority.(ii) For local authorities whose boundary is contained wholly within a single sub-ICB location, but is not equal to the whole sub-ICB location, the LA denominator is estimated as a proportion of the sub-ICB location\u0026nbsp;figure.(iii) For local authorities whose boundaries include all or part of more than one sub-ICB location, the local authority denominator is estimated by aggregating the appropriate proportions of the denominators for the sub-ICB locations\u0026nbsp;whose boundaries include part of the local authority.The appropriate proportions in cases ii and iii are defined according to the numbers of births in the calendar year overlapping most of the period of the indicator value (2021 births were used for 2022/23 indicator data): births by resident LA and sub-ICB location were extracted from the ONS birth file, to give the number of births in every LA-sub-ICB location\u0026nbsp;overlapping block.To calculate the denominator, each LA-sub-ICB location overlap is calculated as a proportion of the sub-ICB location total births, and then multiplied by the indicator denominator for the sub-ICB location.

If there are several LAs within one sub-ICB location they will all have the same prevalence, thereby masking any variation in prevalence which may exist within that sub-ICB location. Former CCG mergers in 2019 mean that more LA\u0027s from then on appear with the same prevalence estimate. Where local authorities cross sub-ICB location boundaries, the local authority estimate is a weighted average of the sub-ICB location indicator values. Where a local authority is within a single sub-ICB location\u0027s boundary, the local authority value presented is the value from the sub-ICB location.\r\nThere has been a change of method for reporting this information from April 2017, removing those whose smoking status is unknown from the calculation. Excluding women with unknown smoking status from the calculation will provide a more accurate representation of the true proportion of women smoking at time of delivery. In the previous definition, women with unknown smoking status were effectively categorised as non-smokers. However, a number of these would be smokers and this therefore served to deflate the indicator value. The overall impact of this change at England level is small, although the impact will be greater for those sub-ICB locations who have a high proportion of unknowns. Work is already underway to encourage and support Trusts/sub-ICB locations\u0026nbsp;to collect and record accurate information. IT issues are reported as the main reason for high levels of unknowns, which should be resolved as systems embed and improve.","copyright":"Copyright \u0026copy; 2023, NHS England","reuse":"This material is Crown Copyright but may be reproduced without formal permission or charge for personal or in-house use and should be acknowledged as \u0027\u00A9Crown Copyright, source: Department of Health and Social Care 2023\u0027.","notes":"From April 2013 responsibility for Women\u0027s Smoking Status at the time of delivery for commissioning these services moved from Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to Clinical Commissioning Group (CCGs), and now sub-ICBs.

It is associated with\u0026nbsp;reduced life expectancy and is a risk factor\u0026nbsp;for a range of chronic diseases, including\u0026nbsp;cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes,\u0026nbsp;at least 12 kinds of cancer,\u0026nbsp;liver, and\u0026nbsp;respiratory\u0026nbsp;disease,\u0026nbsp;and can also impact on\u0026nbsp;mental health. The risk and severity of these diseases increases with a higher body mass index (BMI).The proportion of adults in England living with obesity has seen large increases in the last four decades. Analysis of data from the\u0026nbsp;1980 National Heights and Weights Survey\u0026nbsp;estimates that the prevalence of obesity in England stood at 6% of men and 9% of women aged 16 and over with 0.1% of men and 0.4% of women living with severe obesity. In 1993 the\u0026nbsp;Health Survey for England\u0026nbsp;reported that the prevalence of obesity among men and women in this age group was 13% and 16% respectively which has increased to 27% of men and 29% of women in 2019.\r\nPreventing obesity and putting in place support for people who are overweight or living with obesity is a priority for the Government. In July 2020 the Department of Health and Social Care published a\u0026nbsp;strategy which outlines actions the government will take to tackle the causes of obesity\u0026nbsp;and help adults and children to live healthier lives.\r\nUnderstanding the data, the trends and patterns enables us to make the case for national and local action, which includes policy and approaches to create health promoting environments, healthier food and activity options, social marketing campaigns to support behaviour change and to work with partners to design and tailor approaches to meet needs of particular groups of people.This overweight (including obesity) indicator presents local authority estimates from Sport England\u0027s Active Lives Adult Survey data to help inform local action in preventing obesity and supporting people who are overweight or living with obesity. This indicator is linked to the\u0026nbsp;percentage of adults (aged 18\u002B) classified as obese\u0026nbsp;indicator. These indicators should be used in conjunction to provide a greater understanding of those who are overweight or living with obesity. It is important to track the population\u0027s movement between BMI groups and\u0026nbsp;to understand whether a high prevalence of overweight (including obesity) is driven by greater numbers of people living with obesity or severe obesity, or greater numbers in the overweight category.","dataSource":"OHID, based on Sport England data","method":"The age standardised proportions presented are directly age standardised rates per 100 people, represented as a percentage.

A review of the estimates indicates that for both indicators at England level the values have changed no more than plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. At local authority level for the November 2020 to 2021 estimates, most values remain the same and any changes were no more than plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.May 2022The May 2022 update included a full revision of the data for the excess weight indicator, with all previously published data overwritten. The replacement of all previously published data was required as the adjustments applied to the self-reported height and weight data have been updated by researchers at University College of London (see below for further details). The updated adjustments for height and weight have been applied to the new data point (2020 to 2021) and the whole back series (2015 to 2016 to 2019 to 2020).

Unemployed includes those that reported being unemployed for less than 12 months or more than 12 months. Inactive is defined as those that reported their current working status as retired, looking after house and children or long term sick or disabled. The Working Status category excludes those that report their working status as student or other.DisabilityDisability is defined as self reporting of any physical or mental health conditions or illnesses that have lasted or are expected to last 12 months or more, that have a substantial effect on the ability to carry out normal daily activities.Socioeconomic statusValid respondents were assigned to one of nine National Statistics Socio economic classification (NS SEC) analytic classes. These NS SEC classes were then grouped to provide 8 categories:\r\nManagerial, administrative and professional occupations (NS SEC 1 to 2)\r\nIntermediate occupations (NS SEC 3)\r\nSelf employed and small employers (NS SEC 4)\r\nLower supervisory and technical occupations (NS SEC 5)\r\nRoutine and manual occupations - Semi-routine and routine occupations (NS SEC 6 to 7)\r\nLong term unemployed or never worked (NS SEC 8)\r\nStudents (NS SEC 9)\r\nOther or unclassified (NS SEC 9)\r\nLevel of education Valid respondents selected their highest educational qualification from one of 7 options. This included any educational, professional, vocational or other work-related qualifications for which they received a certificate:Level 4 or above: Degree level or above; Other Higher Education below degree levelLevel 3 and equivalents: A levels, NVQ level 3 and equivalents INFO includes AS level, SVQ and GNVQ level 3, BTEC NationalLevel 2 and equivalents: GCSE or O level grade A* to C, NVQ level 2 and equivalents INFO. This includes SVQ and GNVQ level 2, BTEC first or general diplomaLevel 1 and below: includes GCSE or O level below grade C, CSE below grade 1, NVQ, SVQ and GNVQ level 1, BTEC first or general certificateAnother type of qualification:\u0026nbsp; includes other vocational or professional or foreign qualificationsNo qualificationsLevel of education - data quality note for 2019 to 2020Please

is designed to measure the local burden of acute hepatitis B and is an indicator of ongoing transmission. Hepatitis B is vaccine preventable and an important health protection issue that can cause serious disease. Variation in incidence rate may reflect outbreaks, differences in underlying population e.g. larger proportion of risk groups (e.g. migrants from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users), in addition to variation in uptake of vaccination of risk groups. High rates of acute hepatitis B should prompt a review of cases to determine underlying reasons and to identify appropriate interventions.","dataSource":"UKHSA surveillance Acute Hepatitis B dataset, compiled from laboratory and Health Protection Team reports","method":"Crude rate: count of new diagnoses of acute Hepatitis B divided by the denominator, multipled by 100,000.

For a particular area and time period, it is an estimate of the average number of years a newborn baby would survive if he or she experienced the age specific mortality rates for that area and time period throughout his or her life. Figures reflect mortality among those living in an area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in the area. The figures are not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area could actually expect to live, both because the mortality rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.","rationale":"Life expectancy at birth is a useful summary measure of all cause mortality as it quantifies the differences between areas in units (years of life) that are more readily understood and meaningful to the audience than those of other measures. All cause mortality is a fundamental and probably the oldest measure of the health status of a population. It represents the cumulative effect of the prevalence of risk factors, the prevalence and severity of disease, and the effectiveness of interventions and treatment. Differences in levels of all cause mortality reflect health inequalities between different population groups, e.g. between genders, social classes, and ethnic groups.","dataSource":"OHID, based on Office for National Statistics data","method":"Life expectancy calculations were based on abridged life table approach. Mortality data by sex and age group were extracted from annual files supplied to OHID by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Deaths were allocated to the deceased\u0027s middle super output area (MSOA), lower super output area (LSOA) and output area (OA) of usual residence using the latest version of the National Statistics Postcode Lookup and aggregated to wards and Clinical Commissioning Groups. Deaths were allocated to local authorities and counties based on the ONS geography provided in the death dataset. Population data are mid-year population estimates for the geographical areas descibed as \u0027middle layer super output areas\u0027 (MSOAs), \u0027lower layer super output areas\u0027 (LSOAs), and \u0027output areas\u0027 (OAs) , by sex and single year of age, available from the ONS.Counts by single year of age were aggregated into the age groups required for the calculation of life expectancy (less than 1, 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, then in 5 year age bands through to 80 to 84, 90 and over).\r\nWhat are output areas? The ONS produces mid-year (June) small area population estimates by Output Areas (OA). Output areas are the lowest level of geographic area specifically designed for census data. These standardised geographic areas are designed to have equal numbers of households or populations within them making it easier to compare output areas.\u0026nbsp;\r\nThey are used primarily in statistical administrative data outputs such as the census and population estimates. Output areas are \u0022nested\u0022 within larger geographic areas that can be summed or aggregated to provide data at these larger areas.\u0026nbsp;\r\nThe upper age band used for the calculation of life expectancy in this dataset is 90 years and over. OA deaths and population estimates were aggregated to wards and LSOA deaths and population estimates were aggregated to MSOAs and CCGs using standard geographical lookup tables obtained from ONS Geography.","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":"Confidence intervals were calculated using the method developed by Chiang, which was adjusted according to the method described by Silcocks to account for the variance in the upper age band. \r\n\r\nChiang CL.

Using an upper age band of 90 and over is consistent with subnational life expectancy figures published by ONS, and included in the Public Health Outcomes Framework. This change was made because an increasing proportion of deaths are at ages 85 and over.\u0026nbsp;In some areas, the majority of deaths at age 85 and over may be in the 85 to 89 years age band, while in other areas a large proportion of deaths may be after age 90. Splitting deaths at the oldest ages into two groups (85 to 89 years and 90 years and over) means that the latest life expectancy calculations now take account of such differences in the age structure of populations between areas. The accuracy of the life expectancy estimates is thus improved.","frequency":"Annual","rounding":null,"associatedAreaCodes":["E92000001","E06000001","E06000002","E06000003","E06000004","E06000005","E06000006","E06000007","E06000008","E06000009","E06000010","E06000011","E06000012","E06000013","E06000014","E06000015","E06000016","E06000017","E06000018","E06000019","E06000020","E06000021","E06000022","E06000023","E06000024","E06000025","E06000026","E06000027","E06000030","E06000031","E06000032","E06000033","E06000034","E06000035","E06000036","E06000037","E06000038","E06000039","E06000040","E06000041","E06000042","E06000043","E06000044","E06000045","E06000046","E06000047","E06000049","E06000050","E06000051","E06000052","E06000053","E06000054","E06000055","E06000056","E06000057","E06000058","E06000059","E06000060","E06000061","E06000062","E06000065","E06000066","E07000008","E07000009","E07000010","E07000011","E07000012","E07000032","E07000033","E07000034","E07000035","E07000036","E07000037","E07000038","E07000039","E07000040","E07000041","E07000042","E07000043","E07000044","E07000045","E07000046","E07000047","E07000061","E07000062","E07000063","E07000064","E07000065","E07000066","E07000067","E07000068","E07000069","E07000070","E07000071","E07000072","E07000073","E07000074","E07000075","E07000076","E07000077","E07000078","E07000079","E07000080","E07000081","E07000082","E07000083","E07000084","E07000085","E07000086","E07000087","E07000088","E07000089","E07000090","E07000091","E07000092","E07000093","E07000094","E07000095","E07000096","E07000098","E07000099","E07000102","E07000103","E07000105","E07000106","E07000107","E07000108","E07000109","E07000110","E07000111","E07000112","E07000113","E07000114","E07000115","E07000116","E07000117","E07000118","E07000119","E07000120","E07000121","E07000122","E07000123","E07000124","E07000125","E07000126","E07000127","E07000128","E07000129","E07000130","E07000131","E07000132","E07000133","E07000134","E07000135","E07000136","E07000137","E07000138","E07000139","E07000140","E07000141","E07000142","E07000143","E07000144","E07000145","E07000146","E07000147","E07000148","E07000149","E07000170","E07000171","E07000172","E07000173","E07000174","E07000175","E07000176","E07000177","E07000178","E07000179","E07000180","E07000181","E07000192","E07000193","E07000194","E07000195","E07000196","E07000197","E07000198","E07000199","E07000200","E07000202","E07000203","E07000207","E07000208","E07000209","E07000210","E07000211","E07000212","E07000213","E07000214","E07000215","E07000216","E07000217","E07000218","E07000219","E07000220","E07000221","E07000222","E07000223","E07000224","E07000225","E07000226","E07000227","E07000228","E07000229","E07000234","E07000235","E07000236","E07000237","E07000238","E07000239","E07000240","E07000241","E07000242","E07000243","E07000244","E07000245","E08000001","E08000002","E08000003","E08000004","E08000005","E08000006","E08000007","E08000008","E08000009","E08000010","E08000011","E08000012","E08000013","E08000014","E08000015","E08000016","E08000017","E08000018","E08000019","E08000021","E08000022","E08000023","E08000024","E08000025","E08000026","E08000027","E08000028","E08000029","E08000030","E08000031","E08000032","E08000033","E08000034","E08000035","E08000036","E08000037","E09000001","E09000002","E09000003","E09000004","E09000005","E09000006","E09000007","E09000008","E09000009","E09000010","E09000011","E09000012","E09000013","E09000014","E09000015","E09000016","E09000017","E09000018","E09000019","E09000020","E09000021","E09000022","E09000023","E09000024","E09000025","E09000026","E09000027","E09000028","E09000029","E09000030","E09000031","E09000032","E09000033","E10000003","E10000007","E10000008","E10000011","E10000012","E10000013","E10000014","E10000015","E10000016","E10000017","E10000018","E10000019","E10000020","E10000024","E10000025","E10000028","E10000029","E10000030","E10000031","E10000032","E10000034"],"latestDataPeriod":2016,"earliestDataPeriod":2016,"lastUpdatedDate":"2022-07-05T13:53:07","usedInPoc":true,"hasInequalities":true,"hideInSearch":false,"indicatorID":93283,"polarity":"High

Due to the continued rise of C. difficile infections among the population aged \u0026ge;65 years, the C. difficile mandatory surveillance scheme was enhanced in April 2007, to be patient-level and to cover all C. difficile infections in patients aged 2 years and over.A low value is indicative of a low count of\u0026nbsp;C. difficile.","dataSource":"HCAI Mandatory Surveillance Data","method":"The rate gives the annual rolling rate for a given month.

This is an overall measure of multiple deprivation experienced by people living in an area.","rationale":"Deprivation covers a broad range of issues and refers to unmet needs caused by a lack of resources of all kinds, not just financial. The English Indices of Deprivation attempt to measure a broader concept of multiple deprivation, made up of several distinct dimensions, or domains, of deprivation.The English Indices of Deprivation 2019 are measures of multiple deprivation at the small area level. The model of multiple deprivation which underpins the indices of Deprivation 2019 is based on the idea of distinct domains of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These domains are experienced by individuals living in an area. People may be counted in one or more of the domains, depending on the number and the types of deprivation that they experience. Each domain represents a specific form of deprivation experienced by people and each can be measured individually using a number of indicators. Seven distinct domains have been identified in the English Indices of Deprivation; Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education, Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and services, Living Environment Deprivation and Crime. Individual domains can be used in isolation as measures of each specific form of deprivation. They can also be combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there. Along with two supplementary indices, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and Income Index Affecting Older People Index, they form the English Indices of Deprivation. These statistics allow the most, and least, deprived areas of the country to be identified as well as providing information about the issues faced by people living in different parts of the country.","dataSource":"English indices of deprivation 2019, Ministry of Housing, Communities \u0026 Local Government","method":"For GP deprivation scores, the population weighting is based on NHS Digital, Patients Registered at a GP Practice - April 2019:\u0026nbsp;LSOA file (persons).\u0026nbsp;For more information, please see the Technical Report for 2019 IMD publication.

single adult, or a married or cohabitating couple, or a Civil Partnership, and any dependent children.\r\nEquivalised income is income Before Housing Costs (BHC) and includes contributions from earnings, state support and pensions. Equivalisation adjusts incomes for family size and composition, taking an adult couple with no children as the reference point.\r\nAbsolute low income is defined as a family in low income Before Housing Costs (BHC) in the reference year in comparison with incomes in 2010 to 2011. A family must have claimed one or more of Universal Credit, Tax Credits or Housing Benefit at any point in the year to be classed as low income in these statistics.\r\nAbsolute low income takes the 60 percent of median income threshold from 2010 to 2011 and then fixes this in real terms (i.e. the line moves with inflation). This is designed to assess how low incomes are faring with reference to inflation. It measures the number and proportion of individuals who have incomes below this threshold. The percentage of individuals in absolute low income will decrease ifindividuals with lower incomes see their incomes rise by more than inflation. Statistics are calibrated to the 3 year average Households Below Average Income (HBAI) Regional and work status aggregates, so that the Great Britain and Region totals in the statistics match equivalent statistics in the 3 year average HBAI\u0026nbsp;statistics.Some of the information in this section is taken from Household Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics.","rationale":"The Marmot Review (2010) suggests there is evidence that childhood poverty leads to premature mortality and poor health outcomes for adults. Reducing the numbers of children who experience poverty should improve these adult health outcomes and increase healthy life expectancy.\u0026nbsp; There is also a wide variety of evidence to show that children who live in poverty are exposed to a range of risks that can have a serious impact on their mental health.\u0026nbsp; The Marmot Review recommended a policy objective of giving every child the best start in life.Health Equity in England: The Marmot Review 10 Years On\u0026nbsp;outlines that since 2010, progress has been made in early years development, as measured by children\u0026rsquo;s readiness for school. However, clear socioeconomic inequalities persist, with a graded relationship between these measures andlevel of deprivation. Rates of child poverty, a critical measure for early child development, have increased since 2010 to 2011 with over four million children affected, particularly in families with parents in work. However, child poverty rates are still highest for children living in workless families, in excess of 70 percent.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Many countries in the OECD have considerably lower rates of child poverty than England.\u0026nbsp;The Department for Work and Pensions has a statutory obligation\u0026nbsp;to publish a measure of relative and absolute low income, and low income and material deprivation for children under section 4 of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Sourced from survey data the\u0026nbsp;Household Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics provide estimates of children in low income families only at national and regional levels. To fill the demand from users for local estimates, administrative data has historically been used to produce Official Statistics published by Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)\u0026nbsp;Children in out-of-work benefit households\u0026nbsp;and HM Revenue \u0026amp; Customs (HMRC)\u0026nbsp;Children in low-income families local measure.\u0026nbsp;With the rollout of Universal Credit and the Higher Income Child Benefit charge, neither of the historic measures now offers an accurate view of children in low income families at a local level.\u0026nbsp;This new combined set of statistics provide a more coherent picture of children in low income families at a local level.The presence of large numbers of individuals with relatively high incomes results in a skewed or non symmetric distribution. As a result, the median income is the standard measure of average income as changes in the mean can be driven by extreme values. The median represents the income of the individual in the middle of the distribution.These statistics are Before Housing Costs.\u0026nbsp; It is not currently possible to calculate local area statistics After Housing Costs because administrative datasets covering housing costs are not available.The children in absolute low income families measure is useful for tracking changes over time in relation to a fixed reference point and is designed to assess how low incomes are faring with reference to inflation.Some information in this section has been sourced from Children in low income families local area statistics: Background information and methodology\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;Household Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics","dataSource":"Office for Health Improvement and Disparities","method":"Percentages have been derived by dividing the number of children aged 0 to 15 in absolute low income families by the number of all children aged 0 to 15 (sourced from ONS mid year population estimates) and multiplying by 100.\u0026nbsp;Statistics are calibrated to Household Below Average Income estimates at regional level and by work status.

This assumes that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined income of the household. Thus, all members of any one household will appear at the same point in the income distribution.Equivalence scales conventionally take an adult couple without children as the reference point, with an equivalence value of one.

Alcohol misuse is estimated to cost the NHS about \u0026pound;3.5 billion per year and society as a whole \u0026pound;21 billion annually.\r\nThe Government has said that everyone has a role to play in reducing the harmful use of alcohol - this indicator is one of the key contributions by the Government (and the Department of Health and Social Care) to promote measurable, evidence based prevention activities at a local level, and supports the national ambitions to reduce harm set out in the Government\u0027s Alcohol Strategy. This ambition is part of the monitoring arrangements for the Responsibility Deal Alcohol Network. Alcohol-related deaths can be reduced through local interventions to reduce alcohol misuse and harm.\r\nThe proportion of disease attributable to alcohol (alcohol attributable fraction) is calculated using a relative risk (a fraction between 0 and 1) specific to each disease, age group and sex combined with the prevalence of alcohol consumption in the population. All mortality records are extracted that contain an attributable disease and the age and sex specific fraction applied. The results are summed into quinary age bands for the numerator and a directly standardised rate calculated using the European Standard Population.\u0026nbsp;This revised indicator uses updated alcohol attributable fractions, based on new relative risks from \u0026lsquo;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update\u0026rsquo; (1) published by PHE in 2020. A detailed comparison between the 2013 and 2020 alcohol attributable fractions is available in Appendix 3 of the PHE report (2). A consultation was also undertaken with stakeholders where the impact of the new methodology on the LAPE indicators was quantified and explored (3).\r\nThe calculation that underlies all alcohol-related indicators has been updated to take account of the latest academic evidence and more recent alcohol-consumption figures. The result has been that the newly published mortality and admission rates are lower than those previously published. This is due to a change in methodology, mainly because alcohol consumption across the population has reduced since 2010. Therefore, the number of deaths and hospital admissions that we attribute to alcohol has reduced because in general people are drinking less today than they were when the original calculation was made.\r\nFigures published previously did not misrepresent the burden of alcohol based on the previous evidence \u0026ndash; the methodology used in this update is as close as sources and data allow to the original method. Though the number of deaths and admissions attributed to alcohol each year has reduced, the direction of trend and the key inequalities due to alcohol harm remain the same. Alcohol remains a significant burden on the health of the population and the harm alcohol causes to individuals remains unchanged.\r\nReferences:\r\n(1)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2020) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-attributable-fractions-for-england-an-update\r\n(2)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2020) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update: Appendix 3\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892879/APPEND_3-update.pdf\r\n(3)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2021) Proposed changes for calculating alcohol-related mortality\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-for-calculating-alcohol-related-mortality","dataSource":"Calculated by Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Death Extract Public Health Mortality File and ONS Mid Year Population Estimates.","method":"Numerator data for each age band are divided by the denominator population data for each age band respectively to give age specific death rates for the area.\u0026nbsp;These age specific rates are multiplied by the standard population for each age group respectively and aggregated across all the age groups to give the age adjusted count of deaths for the area.\u0026nbsp;This age adjusted count of deaths is divided by the total standard population for the whole age range included in the indicator, and multiplied by 100,000 to give the age standardised mortality rate for the area.\r\nThe methodology for calculating the alcohol attributable fractions is published by PHE in \u0026lsquo;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update\u0026rsquo; (4).

There is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer, exacerbates asthma and has a contributory role in mortality (Air Pollution Evidence Review from Public Health England, 2019 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/improving-outdoor-air-quality-and-health-review-of-interventions). The annual burden of long-term exposure to air pollution in the UK has been estimated to be an effect equivalent to 29,000 to 43,000 deaths at typical ages ( UKHSA Chemical Hazards and Poisons Report, 2022).?\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough air pollution can be harmful to everyone, it particularly affects people living in polluted areas, those who are exposed to higher levels of air pollution in their day to day lives, and those who are more susceptible to health problems caused by air pollution, widening health inequalities (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-matters-air-pollution).\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual average metric is a summary of typical environmental conditions and the population weighting accounts for human exposure. In addition to this indicator, other air pollutants (such as NO2), as well as indoor air pollutants, are also considered important. However, methodological considerations make it impractical to include these in a health outcomes indicator at present.\u0026nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\u0026nbsp;Inclusion of this indicator in the Public Health Outcomes Framework enables Directors of Public Health to prioritise action on air quality in their local area to help reduce the health burden from air pollution. \r\n","dataSource":"Background annual average PM2.5 concentrations for the year of interest are modelled on a 1km x 1km grid using an air dispersion model, and calibrated using measured concentrations taken from background sites in Defra\u2019s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/interactive-map). By approximating LA boundaries to the 1km by 1km grid, and using census population data, population weighted background PM2.5 concentrations for each lower tier LA are calculated. This work is completed under contract to Defra, as a small extension of its obligations under the Ambient Air Quality Directive (2008/50/EC). Concentrations of total PM2.5 are used for estimating the mortality burden attributable to particulate air pollution (COMEAP, 2022).","method":"An increase of 10 \u0026micro;g/m3 in population-weighted annual average background concentration of PM2.5* is assumed to increase all cause mortality rates by 8% - a relative risk (RR) of 1.08 per 10 \u0026micro;g/m3 (COMEAP, 2022). For a population weighted modelled annual average background PM2.5 concentration x, RR is calculated as (1.08)^(x/10) (as explained in PHE, 2014). The fraction of deaths attributable to PM2.5 is expressed as a percentage, calculated as 100*(RR-1)/RR.\u0026nbsp;\r\nFor example for the the year 2021 England air pollution was 7.4 \u0026micro;g/m3.\u0026nbsp;\r\nTo calculate the RR for England you use the following formula:\r\nRR = 1.08^(7.4/10)\r\nRR = 1.059\r\nTo calculate the attributable fraction:\r\nAF = (1.059 - 1)/1.059 * 100\r\nAF = 5.54%\r\n\u0026nbsp;Population weighted annual average concentrations of PM2.5 were provided by Ricardo for all lower tier and unitary local authorities within England, as well as combined at upper tier, regional and national level.

This means that, in the region of 10 \u0026micro;g/m3, the true attributable fractions are likely to be in the range of 80 to 110% of the central estimates reported, with these factors changing only trivially over the range of concentrations considered.\u0026nbsp;This confidence interval reflects the uncertainty in the relationship between ambient PM2.5 concentrations and effects on mortality. Thus, whilst it is important in terms of the size of the absolute effect, it does not reflect uncertainties which would affect comparisons over time or between areas. Because of this, the confidence intervals are not presented in the indicator. There is no accepted way of fully quantifying the uncertainty associated with modelled concentrations of PM2.5 (see Caveats).\u0026nbsp;While there is some uncertainty in the relative risk estimate and hence in the estimate of the fraction of mortality attributed to PM2.5 estimates for the local authorities all use the same relative risk, and the variation in the attributable fraction between local authorities is strongly predicted by the variation in PM2.5 concentration in the local authorities. Therefore, the above confidence intervals are not relevant to comparisons between local authorities and are not presented with this indicator.

It is a clinically safe and effective micro-surgical procedure, associated with good functional outcomes for both first and second eye surgery. It remains a high volume NHS activity with surgery predominantly (85%) performed in adults of 65 years of age and over. Whilst cataract is a major cause of global vision impairment and blindness, it infrequently causes certifiable sight impairment in the UK.Surgical activity has steadily increased and is expected to continue to do so as demand continues to rise with the ageing population.At least a third of all procedures are consistently for second eye surgery. Periodically there have been restrictions on access to surgery (particularly second eye surgery) as a means to reduce costs to manage health budgetary restrictions. However NICE Guideline NG77 recognises the need for cataract surgery in both eyes, and its contribution to maintaining population eye health.The Atlas of Variation in risk factors and healthcare for vision in England showed during 2019/20, almost 384,000 cataract operations were performed in the NHS.

Specifically, it quantifies the imprecision that results from random variation in the measurement of the indicator. A wider confidence interval shows that the indicator value presented is likely to be a less precise estimate of the true underlying value.Dobson \u0026amp; Byar\u0026rsquo;s method is used for calculating confidence intervals for directly standardised rates. Where there are repeat attendances to hospital during the year the Dobson \u0026amp; Byar\u0026rsquo;s method has been used with an adjustment to the variance to take this into account.A confidence interval is calculated for the observed total count of events using Byar\u0026rsquo;s method,1\u0026nbsp;which gives very accurate approximate confidence intervals for counts based on the assumption of a Poisson distribution and is sufficiently accurate for counts as low as 10, the minimum count recommended for DSRs. This interval is then weighted and scaled to give the interval for the standardised rate using the method described by Dobson.2\u0026nbsp;The method is described in detail in APHO Technical Briefing 3: Commonly used public health statistics and their confidence intervals.3\u0026nbsp;Full technical details of the new methodology will be made available soon and can be requested from healthcare.variation@dhsc.gov.uk1\u0026nbsp;Breslow NE, Day NE.\u0026nbsp;Statistical methods in cancer research, volume II: The design and analysis of cohort studies.\u0026nbsp;Lyon: International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization; 1987: 69.2\u0026nbsp;Dobson A et al.

All records without a practice code, and those with a practice code that is not recognised but does not indicate that responsibility is outside England, are allocated using the patient postcode, to the ICB sub-location within whose geographical boundary they live.This indicator numerator is based on admission to hospital for cataract surgery. This counts the number of times that a person has attended hospital in the year, and not the person themselves.Values may be different to those previously published due to NHS digital implementing an improved method of matching of patients across all national patient-level datasets. For me details see - Master Person Service (MPS) - NHS Digital NHS Digital has identified a data quality issue affecting HES data for East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust (RXC) in 2018/19. Approximately 85,000 records erroneously had all diagnosis codes removed. Therefore, OHID have not published values for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 10% of patients from that area with missing diagnosis codes from RXC in the current year (2018/19). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients with missing diagnosis codes from RXC have been flagged to be treated with caution.\u0026nbsp;NHS England identified a data quality issue affecting Frimley Health Foundation Trust in 2022 to 2023. Frimley Health Foundation Trust did not submit HES data for June 2022 to March 2023. Therefore, areas have been suppressed where many patients were likely to have been treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust and neighbouring areas have been flagged to be treated with caution.For more details please see\u0026nbsp;https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/the-processing-cycle-and-hes-data-quality\r\nIn 2023, NHS England announced a methodological change to require Trusts to report Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) to the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS) by July 2024. Early adopter sites began to report SDEC to ECDS from 2021/22, with other Trusts changing their reporting in 2022/23 or 2023/24. Some Trusts had previously reported this activity as part of the Admitted Patient Care data set, and moving to report to ECDS may reduce the number of admissions reported for this/these indicator/s.
