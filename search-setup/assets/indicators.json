Over 30% of records from this trust did not have a valid geography of residence assigned. Therefore, values have not been published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 20% of patients from that area treated at NUH in the previous year (2015 to 2016).

Approximately 85,000 records erroneously had all diagnosis codes removed. Therefore, values have not been published for indicators based on HES data for areas that had more than 10% of patients from that area with missing diagnosis codes from RXC in the current year (2018 to 2019). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients with missing diagnosis codes from RXC have been flagged to be treated with caution.NHS England identified a data quality issue affecting Frimley Health Foundation Trust in 2022 to 2023. Frimley Health Foundation Trust did not submit HES data for June 2022 to March 2023. Therefore, values have not been published based on HES data for areas that had over 10% of hospital patients from an area treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022).

Babies born to infected mothers are given a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine after they are born. This is followed by another two doses (with a month in between each) and a booster dose 24 months later. Around 20% of people with chronic hepatitis B will go on to develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), which can take 20 years to develop, and around 1 in 10 people with cirrhosis will develop liver cancer.\r\nVaccination coverage is the best indicator of the level of protection a population will have against vaccine preventable communicable diseases. Coverage is closely correlated with levels of disease. Monitoring coverage identifies possible drops in immunity before levels of disease rise.\r\nSince April 2000 it has been recommended that all pregnant women in England and Wales should be offered testing for hepatitis B through screening for HBsAg, and that all babies of HBsAg seropositive women should be immunised (HSC 1998 127). A dose of paediatric hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all infants born to an HBV infected mother as soon as possible after birth, then at 1 and 2, and 24 months of age (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/hepatitis-b-guidance-data-and-analysis).

As well as it being an avoidable experience for the young woman, abortions represent an avoidable cost to the NHS. And while for some young women having a child when young can represent a positive turning point in their lives, for many more teenagers bringing up a child is extremely difficult and often results in poor outcomes for both the teenage parent and the child, in terms of the baby\u0026rsquo;s health, the mother\u0026rsquo;s emotional health and well-being and the likelihood of both the parent and child living in long-term poverty.\r\nResearch evidence, particularly from longitudinal studies, shows that teenage pregnancy is associated with poorer outcomes for both young parents and their children. Teenage mothers are less likely to finish their education, are more likely to bring up their child alone and in poverty and have a higher risk of poor mental health than older mothers. Infant mortality rates for babies born to teenage mothers are around 60% higher than for babies born to older mothers. The children of teenage mothers have an increased risk of living in poverty and poor quality housing and are more likely to have accidents and behavioural problems.\r\nAs well as being included in the Public Health Outcomes Framework, teenage pregnancy has also been included as a child poverty strategy indicator 2011-14, in the \u0022A New Approach to Child Poverty: Tackling the Causes of Disadvantage and Transforming Families\u0027 Lives\u0022 document, published jointly between the Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Education, April 2011More background information and advice on tackling teenage pregnancy is provided in Public Health England\u0027s joint paper with the Local Government Association (LGA) published January 2016 \u0027Good progress but more to do - Teenage pregnancy and young parents\u0027","dataSource":"OHID, based on Office for National Statistics data","method":"Crude rate: numerator is divided by denominator and then multiplied by 1,000","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":"Office for National Statistics (ONS), Conceptions in England and Wales","countDefinition":"Number of pregnancies that occur in women aged under 18 and result in either one or more live or still births or a legal abortion under the Abortion Act 1967.","denominatorSource":"Office for National Statistics (ONS), Mid-year population estimates","denominatorDefinition":"Number of women aged 15-17 living in the area","disclouseControl":"For Isles of Scilly and City of London, no indicator data are presented, to prevent disclosure of small numbers.

Whilst this is mainly due to uncorrected refractive error and untreated cataract, the research implies that the take up of sight tests is lower than would be expected. This is particularly the case within areas of social deprivation. Low take up of sight tests can lead to later detection of preventable conditions and increased sight loss due to late intervention.\r\nInclusion of this indicator in the public health outcomes framework will ensure that avoidable sight loss is recognised as a critical and modifiable public health issue. Prevention of avoidable sight loss is recognised as a key priority for the WHO\u0027s global initiative for the 2030 targets on effective coverage of eye care. The overarching aim of the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) to which the UK is a signatory - is to improve the coverage of eye health and prevent blindness\u0026nbsp;https://www.iapb.org/about/2030-in-sight/\u0026nbsp;It is a particularly important issue in the context of an ageing population.The Law Commission report (Adult Social Care, May 2011) recommended that local authorities should maintain a register of blind and partially sighted people (Paragraphs 12.15 to 12.18)3\u0026nbsp;and this recommendation has been accepted by Department of Health and Social Care Ministers. Completion of a CVI (Certificate of Visual Impairment) by a consultant ophthalmologist, initiates the process of registration with a local authority and leads to access to services.Risk of sight loss is heavily influenced by health inequalities, including ethnicity, deprivation and age.

Certification is voluntary so true rates may be higher than this analysis shows. Incidence may vary due to the risk of sight loss being influenced by health inequalities, including ethnic, deprivation and age profiles of the local population. People that have a Certificate of Vision Impairment from an ophthalmologist choose whether or not to be included in their local authority\u0026rsquo;s register of blind or partially sighted people (registration is not automatic). Those that register become eligible for certain concessions. This means that not everybody that has been certified as having a vision impairment is recorded on a local authority register.There are also geographic variations in data collection. In some instances completion of additional examinations required to complete the certification are incentivised. Due to this, data collection levels may reflect non-completion of certification rather than just low incidence. Analysis by Moorfields has shown that there is greater than a 10% difference in 2010 to 11 between certifications of visual impairment (CVIs) and registrations with local authorities in these areas: Bath and North East Somerset, Birmingham, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Bristol, Bromley, Bury, Croydon, Dudley, Hillingdon, Kingston upon Thames, Leeds, Luton, Manchester, Medway Towns, North Lincolnshire, North Somerset, Redbridge, Rochdale, Salford, Sandwell, South Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Stockport, Stoke on Trent, Tameside, Trafford, Walsall, Warwickshire and Wiltshire, and\u0026nbsp; comparison to an expected value produced by indirect standardisation methods.

Falls that results in injury can be very serious - approximately 1 in 20 older people living in the community experience a fracture or need hospitalisation after a fall. Falls and fractures in those aged 65 and above account for over 4 million bed days per year in England alone, at an estimated cost of \u0026pound;2 billion [3].\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has produced a quality standard that covers assessment after a fall and preventing further falls (secondary prevention) in older people living in the community and during a hospital stay. The standard is designed to drive measurable improvements in the 3 dimensions of quality: patient safety, patient experience and clinical effectiveness. [2]\r\nThis measure should be understood in terms of assessing health service utilisation:\u0026nbsp; the number divided by\u0026nbsp; rate of patients with falls related emergency admissions entering a hospital setting. It should not be used to assess need as many injurious falls will not result in emergency admissions. It should also not be used to assess falls prevention service effectiveness as there are a number of conditions which will increase susceptibility to injury, including osteoporosis, the treatment of which is the remit of other services.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\r\n1.

Early adopter sites began to report SDEC to ECDS from 2021/22, with other Trusts changing their reporting in 2022/23 or 2023/24. Some Trusts had previously reported this activity as part of the Admitted Patient Care data set, and moving to report to ECDS may reduce the number of admissions reported for this indicator. NHSE have advised it is not possible accurately to identify SDEC in current data flows, but the impact of the change is expected to vary by diagnosis, with indicators related to injuries and external causes potentially most affected.\r\nWhen considering if SDEC recording practice has reduced the number of admissions reported for this indicator at local level, please refer to the\u0026nbsp;published list\u0026nbsp;of sites who have reported when they began to report SDEC to ECDS.\r\nHospital admissions have been used as a proxy of the prevalence of falls injuries, these are only the tip of the iceberg in relation to the health and well being burden of falls. Inpatient hospital admissions are a proportion of falls incidents, more may present to A\u0026amp;E and GPs, not all of which will lead to hospital admission.This indicator only counts falls that have been coded in the cause field and Injuries in primary diagnosis field. It has been observed that there are situations where falls (ICD10 W00 to W19) and Injuries (S00 to T98) are coded in secondary diagnosis fields. This may result in underestimation of falls resulting in injuries.HES inpatient data are generally considered to be complete and robust. However, there may be a question regarding the quality of external cause coding and differences in admission thresholds. There may be variation between Trusts in the way hospital admissions are coded. There may be variation in data recording completeness. Injury information could potentially be missing in the admission episode record but added instead to a subsequent episode record. In addition, some transfers which are also coded as episode order 1 (epiorder 1) and emergency could lead to double counting.Of particular relevance is the coding of external cause. Routine data do not allow for all of these aspects to be identified and removed from the indicator, however, this may be done through local audit.","copyright":"\u0026copy; Crown Copyright Under the terms of the Open Government licence (OGL)","reuse":"This material is Crown Copyright but may be reproduced without formal permission or charge for personal or in house use and should be acknowledged as \u00A9 Crown Copyright, source: Office for Health Improvement and Disparities 2024\u0027.","notes":"\r\nFollowing Census 2021, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) carried out reconciliation and rebasing of the mid year population estimates (MYE) it produces. This process happens every 10 years following the census. The official population estimates for mid 2012 to mid 2020 have been revised, to incorporate the data now available from Census 2021. The data for this indicator has been revised to use the rebased population estimates from 2012 onwards.\r\nWhere the observed total number of admissions is less than 10, the rates have been suppressed as there are too few admissions to calculate directly standardised rates reliably. The cut off has been reduced from 25, following research commissioned by PHE and in preparation for publication which shows DSRs and their confidence intervals are robust whenever the count is at least 10.\r\nThis indicator was calculated using age standardisation (as opposed to age sex standardisation) and the England value was changed to include the records where the LA of residence equals \u0026lsquo;U\u0026rsquo; (England NOS).

Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients with missing diagnosis codes from RXC have been flagged to be treated with caution.\r\nNHS England identified a data quality issue affecting Frimley Health Foundation Trust in 2022 to 2023. Frimley Health Foundation Trust did not submit HES data for June 2022 to March 2023. Therefore, values have not been published based on HES data for areas that had over 10% of hospital patients from an area treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022). Areas with between 1 to 10% of patients treated at Frimley Health Foundation Trust in the previous year (2021 to 2022) have been flagged to be treated with caution.\r\n","frequency":"Annual","rounding":"All sub national counts are rounded to the nearest 5.

The population monitoring cut offs for overweight and obesity are lower than the clinical cut offs (91st and 98th centiles for overweight and obesity) used to assess individual children; this is to capture children in the population in the clinical overweight or obesity BMI categories and those who are at high risk of moving into the clinical overweight or clinical obesity categories. This helps ensure that adequate services are planned and delivered for the whole population.","rationale":"There is concern about the rise of childhood obesity and the implications of obesity persisting into adulthood. The risk of obesity in adulthood and risk of future obesity-related ill health are greater as children get older. Studies tracking child obesity into adulthood have found that the probability of children who are overweight and living with obesity becoming overweight or obese adults increases with age1,2,3. The health consequences of childhood obesity include: increased blood lipids, glucose intolerance, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, increases in liver enzymes associated with fatty liver, exacerbation of conditions such as asthma and psychological problems such as social isolation, low self-esteem, teasing and bullying.Child obesity prevalence shows a close association with socioeconomic deprivation. Obesity prevalence in children living in the 10% most deprived areas of the country is more than double that of children living in the least deprived 10% of areas4. Between ethnic groups, obesity prevalence substantially varies; these differences remain when potentially confounding factors, such as levels of deprivation and urban environment are controlled for5,6,7,8.These data indicators enable monitoring of the national ambition to \u0022significantly reduce childhood obesity\u0022 as set out in\u0026nbsp;\u0022Child Obesity A Plan for Action\u0022.\r\nThe National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence have produced guidelines to tackle obesity in adults and children -\u0026nbsp;Obesity: the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children.1\u0026nbsp;Guo SS, Chumlea WC.

Local authorities are mandated to collect data from mainstream state-maintained schools but collection of data from special schools (schools for pupils with special educational needs and pupil referral units) and independent schools is encouraged. For the 2022/23 collection, 4,802 records were collected relating to pupils in independent/special schools. This represents only 0.4% of the total number of records across all state and independent/special schools.Since the proportion of records from independent and special schools is low and varies each year, analysis of NCMP data by NHS England and DHSC excludes such records to ensure consistency over time. There are also concerns around how representative the participating independent and special schools would be.Deprivation has been assigned using the assigned Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) in the NCMP dataset, up to 2014/15 to 2018/19. Deprivation using IMD 2019 has been assigned to data for 2015/16 to 2019/20 onwards.The indicator is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator and then multiplying by 100 to produce the percentage.","standardPopulation":null,"ciMethodDetails":null,"countSource":"NHS England, National Child Measurement Programme, https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/","countDefinition":"Number of children in year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) with a valid height and weight measured by the NCMP with a BMI classified as living with obesity or severe obesity.","denominatorSource":"NHS England, National Child Measurement Programme, https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-child-measurement-programme/","denominatorDefinition":"Number of children in year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) with a valid height and weight measured by the NCMP.","disclouseControl":"City of London totals have been included with Hackney and Isles of Scilly totals with Cornwall UA to prevent potential disclosure of individuals.Any value based on a numerator that is 7 or less is suppressed.

Obesity Profile. 2023 https://fingertips.phe.org.uk \u00A9 Crown copyright","notes":"The local authority level data for obesity prevalence by sex, ethnic group, and deprivation quintile in the inequalities tab of the Obesity Profile uses 5 years worth of data combined to ensure a large enough sample size for reliable estimates.Data from the 2020/21 NCMP collection year has not been included in the 5-year combined indicators. Around 300,000 children (25% of previous full measurement years) were measured enabling robust prevalence estimates to be produced at national and regional level, however the sample did not enable the production of comprehensive and robust local authority level data. To ensure that large enough numbers are available for analysis, an additional year of NCMP data is included instead of 2020/21; data for 2017/18-21/22 uses 2016/17 data instead of 2020/21, and data for 2018/19-22/23 uses 2017/18 data instead of 2020/21.\u0026nbsp;Data are provided in the Inequalities data view, for sex, ethnicity and deprivation.\r\nLocal authority and region geographies are derived from the postcode of child residency; only children with valid geographical coding (postcode of residence) have been included in this analysis. The proportion of records with such coding has increased over the years of the NCMP. In 2006/07 (the first year of the NCMP) around 57% of child records included valid postcode of residence. This increased to 95% in 2007/08, and to over 99% in 2008/09 and subsequent years.Recording of ethnicity has improved overtime, but data from the earlier years of the NCMP collection may not be fully complete; the proportion of records with valid ethnicity coding has increased substantially since the NCMP inception. In 2006/07 only 32% of child records had an informative ethnicity code (i.e. not \u0026lsquo;unknown\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;not stated\u0026rsquo;), in 2009/10, this had increased to 83%, and since then has remained over 80%. It is possible that completeness of ethnicity coding may vary with weight status, leading to potential bias in the prevalence estimates. Such bias is hard to detect. Lower rates of ethnicity coding in the earlier years of NCMP also lead to smaller numbers of children in each ethnic group.In some years, local authorities have been unable to provide ethnicity data. Therefore caution should be applied when interpreting obesity prevalence by ethnic group, and the data presented here should be viewed in conjunction with the data quality indicators presented in the \u0022Data quality\u0022 section of this tool.Deprivation data are provided by deprivation quintiles (groups of\u0026nbsp; five equal-sized bands), based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile (ten equal-sized bands).\u0026nbsp;2019 IMD is applied to 2015/16-2019/20\u0026nbsp; and later data. IMD for all previous years uses that provided in the dataset each year by NHS England. Not all local authorities will contain areas for each deprivation quintile, for example, some local authorities within England have no areas that are in the most deprived category. In 2013/14, no postcode data were supplied for children attending school in Herefordshire. Since a deprivation category can only be applied where the postcode is known, it is advised that data for obesity prevalence by deprivation is viewed in conjunction with the data quality indicator for completion of child postcode presented in the \u0022Data quality\u0022 section of this tool.To help understand some of the diversity within local authorities and examine pockets of high obesity prevalence, OHID produces child weight data by MSOA and Ward for all of England, available in the \u0022Child prevalence small area data\u0022\u0026nbsp;section of this profile.","frequency":"Annual measurements during academic year.

To ensure we align with the CMO guidelines OHID also publish the estimates for those aged 19 and over.(1). Physical inactivity is defined as engaging in less than 30 minutes of physical activity per week. This is the same definition as one of the KPIs in the current government sport strategy (Sporting Future: A New Strategy for an Active Nation)(2). The strategy reports the percentage of adults physically inactive and is measured by the \u0026ldquo;percentage doing less than 30 mins physical activity each week\u0026rdquo;. (2). Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality accounting for 6% of deaths globally. People who have a physically active lifestyle have a 20 to 35% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and stroke compared to those who have a sedentary lifestyle.\u0026nbsp; Regular physical activity is also associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and colon/breast cancer and with improved mental health.\u0026nbsp; In older adults physical activity is associated with increased functional capacities. The estimated direct cost of physical inactivity to the NHS across the UK is over \u0026pound;0.9 billion per year.The CMO currently recommends that adults undertake a minimum of 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of moderate physical activity per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week or an equivalent combination of the two (MVPA), in bouts of 10 minutes or more. The overall amount of activity is more important than the type, intensity or frequency.(1).While increasing the activity levels of all adults who are not meeting the recommendations is important, targeting those adults who are significantly inactive (i.e. engaging in less than 30 minutes of activity per week) will produce the greatest reduction in chronic disease.(1).Public Health England co-produced the \u0026lsquo;Everybody active, every day\u0026rsquo; framework.(3) This is a national, evidence-based approach to support all sectors to embed physical activity into the fabric of daily life and make it an easy, cost-effective and \u0026lsquo;normal\u0026rsquo; choice in every community in England. To make everybody active every day a reality we need to monitor progress and measure the impact at a population, organisational, programme and individual level. The key outcomes within the public health outcomes framework (PHOF) will be central, ie, the percentage of adults physically inactive (primary outcome, PHOF 2.13ii) and physically active (secondary, PHOF 2.13i).Evidence for the effectiveness of interventions to increase the population levels of physical activity is summarised by Kahn et al.(4)1.

Former CCG mergers in 2019 mean that more LA\u0027s from then on appear with the same prevalence estimate. Where local authorities cross sub-ICB location boundaries, the local authority estimate is a weighted average of the sub-ICB location indicator values. Where a local authority is within a single sub-ICB location\u0027s boundary, the local authority value presented is the value from the sub-ICB location.\r\nThere has been a change of method for reporting this information from April 2017, removing those whose smoking status is unknown from the calculation. Excluding women with unknown smoking status from the calculation will provide a more accurate representation of the true proportion of women smoking at time of delivery. In the previous definition, women with unknown smoking status were effectively categorised as non-smokers. However, a number of these would be smokers and this therefore served to deflate the indicator value. The overall impact of this change at England level is small, although the impact will be greater for those sub-ICB locations who have a high proportion of unknowns. Work is already underway to encourage and support Trusts/sub-ICB locations\u0026nbsp;to collect and record accurate information.

The risk and severity of these diseases increases with a higher body mass index (BMI).The proportion of adults in England living with obesity has seen large increases in the last four decades. Analysis of data from the\u0026nbsp;1980 National Heights and Weights Survey\u0026nbsp;estimates that the prevalence of obesity in England stood at 6% of men and 9% of women aged 16 and over with 0.1% of men and 0.4% of women living with severe obesity.

This assumes that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined income of the household. Thus, all members of any one household will appear at the same point in the income distribution.Equivalence scales conventionally take an adult couple without children as the reference point, with an equivalence value of one.

Alcohol misuse is estimated to cost the NHS about \u0026pound;3.5 billion per year and society as a whole \u0026pound;21 billion annually.\r\nThe Government has said that everyone has a role to play in reducing the harmful use of alcohol - this indicator is one of the key contributions by the Government (and the Department of Health and Social Care) to promote measurable, evidence based prevention activities at a local level, and supports the national ambitions to reduce harm set out in the Government\u0027s Alcohol Strategy. This ambition is part of the monitoring arrangements for the Responsibility Deal Alcohol Network. Alcohol-related deaths can be reduced through local interventions to reduce alcohol misuse and harm.\r\nThe proportion of disease attributable to alcohol (alcohol attributable fraction) is calculated using a relative risk (a fraction between 0 and 1) specific to each disease, age group and sex combined with the prevalence of alcohol consumption in the population. All mortality records are extracted that contain an attributable disease and the age and sex specific fraction applied. The results are summed into quinary age bands for the numerator and a directly standardised rate calculated using the European Standard Population.\u0026nbsp;This revised indicator uses updated alcohol attributable fractions, based on new relative risks from \u0026lsquo;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update\u0026rsquo; (1) published by PHE in 2020. A detailed comparison between the 2013 and 2020 alcohol attributable fractions is available in Appendix 3 of the PHE report (2). A consultation was also undertaken with stakeholders where the impact of the new methodology on the LAPE indicators was quantified and explored (3).\r\nThe calculation that underlies all alcohol-related indicators has been updated to take account of the latest academic evidence and more recent alcohol-consumption figures. The result has been that the newly published mortality and admission rates are lower than those previously published. This is due to a change in methodology, mainly because alcohol consumption across the population has reduced since 2010. Therefore, the number of deaths and hospital admissions that we attribute to alcohol has reduced because in general people are drinking less today than they were when the original calculation was made.\r\nFigures published previously did not misrepresent the burden of alcohol based on the previous evidence \u0026ndash; the methodology used in this update is as close as sources and data allow to the original method. Though the number of deaths and admissions attributed to alcohol each year has reduced, the direction of trend and the key inequalities due to alcohol harm remain the same. Alcohol remains a significant burden on the health of the population and the harm alcohol causes to individuals remains unchanged.\r\nReferences:\r\n(1)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2020) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-attributable-fractions-for-england-an-update\r\n(2)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2020) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update: Appendix 3\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892879/APPEND_3-update.pdf\r\n(3)\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; PHE (2021) Proposed changes for calculating alcohol-related mortality\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/proposed-changes-for-calculating-alcohol-related-mortality","dataSource":"Calculated by Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Annual Death Extract Public Health Mortality File and ONS Mid Year Population Estimates.","method":"Numerator data for each age band are divided by the denominator population data for each age band respectively to give age specific death rates for the area.\u0026nbsp;These age specific rates are multiplied by the standard population for each age group respectively and aggregated across all the age groups to give the age adjusted count of deaths for the area.\u0026nbsp;This age adjusted count of deaths is divided by the total standard population for the whole age range included in the indicator, and multiplied by 100,000 to give the age standardised mortality rate for the area.\r\nThe methodology for calculating the alcohol attributable fractions is published by PHE in \u0026lsquo;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: an update\u0026rsquo; (4).
