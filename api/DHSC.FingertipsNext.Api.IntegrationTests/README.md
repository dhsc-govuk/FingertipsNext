# API Integration Tests

Please ensure you have started any services and/or docker containers that you will be depending on. The
`backend-services` profile can be used to do this.

Some connection details are obtained from the `.env` file at the root of the repository, so make sure you've followed
the instructions on setting it up in the [README.md](../../README.md).
