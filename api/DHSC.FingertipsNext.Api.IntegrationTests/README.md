# API Integration Tests

Please ensure you have started any services and/or docker containers that you will be depending on. The
`backend-services` profile can be used to do this.

Create an `.env` file based on `.env.template`, and supply any required values. Passwords and server names may need to
match those used to build associated containers/services. Please check the `.env` file in the main FingertipsNext
directory.
