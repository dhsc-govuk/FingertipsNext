    summary: Get health data for an indicator
    description:
      Get data for a public health indicator. This will return all data for
      all requested areas and all time periods for the specified indicator.

      The returned data will include a benchmark comparison against either England or an ancestor area
      group, depending on the benchmark_ref_type and ancestor_code parameters.

      Data can be provided disagregated by various categories such as age and sex
      using the inequalities query parameter.
